An automatic technique for mining and synthesizing succinct and representative human-readable documentation
of program interfaces. Our algorithm is based on a combination of path sensitive dataï¬‚ow analysis, clustering, and pattern abstraction. It produces output in the form of well-typed program snippets which document initialization, method calls, assignments, looping constructs, and exception handling.
